\begin{abstract}
Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects around 1\% of births in the USA [3], and in severe cases requires extensive surgery planning to treat. For doctors planning surgeries, it would be helpful if patient-specific 3D printed models were provided. This requires segmentation of the heart, which involves labelling each voxel of the image with what part of the heart it belongs to. A pre-processing step is to locate a bounding box of the heart. Traditionally, both the segmentation and the localization of the heart has been done manually, especially in patients with CHD.

In this work, we aim to develop fully automatic methods to localize the heart in MRI scans of patients with congenital heart disease. We perform localization by applying a regression forest to the MRI scans of the patient, to find the bounding boxes of the heart. We applied our method on a dataset of 10 patients, training on 9 and testing on the remaining patient. The percentage errors (explained in Section 5.2) were less than 10\% for each patient, showing that our method was successful for patients with CHD.
