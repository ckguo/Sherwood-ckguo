- make code parallel
- try on different substructures
- % offset from border? make sure it isnâ€™t doing something dumb like that
- can we do anything with the covariance matrix?
- bigger dataset?? 20 vs 10
- more parameter searching
- better way of sampling the distribution?
- making sure code is correct?? use fake examples and look at heat map
- set up testing framework?
- remove hardcoded filenames, add more command line arguments

- given substructures, try segmentation
