Congenital heart disease (CHD) affects many children around the world, which sometimes requires extensive surgery planning. For doctors to be able to plan surgeries, it is helpful if scans of the heart are accurately labelled with the different substructures of the heart. Some work has been done to address the issue of image segmentation in hearts with CHD [1], but these methods still require some user input and therefore are not fully automatic.

In this work, we aim to develop methods to localize the heart in MRI scans of patients with congenital heart disease. We perform localization by applying a regression forest to the MRI scans of the patient, to find the bounding boxes of the structures within the heart.
