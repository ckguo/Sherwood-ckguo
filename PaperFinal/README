HOW TO INSTALL AND COMPILE THE PAPER
This package provides all of the files necessary to compile
the enclosed files with Latex.

In order to properly compile the Latex files you will need
to have software already installed on your computer.
General Instructions can be found at this link.

MAC
To do so on a Mac, it's easiest to use MacPorts.
Once MacPorts is installed, you will need to install the
packages texlive-latex and texlive-latex-extra.
Instructions to do each of these can be found at the link
below.

UBUNTU
You will need two packages texlive-latex and texlive-latex-extra.
You can install them both with the command below.

sudo apt-get install texlive-latex

Once Latex is installed on MAC or UBUNTU, to compile the set of
files, run the commands:

pdflatex sample.tex
bibtex sample
pdflatex sample.tex
pdflatex sample.tex

At this point, you should have a pdf called sample.pdf with all
figures and references properly compiled.  Compare your output
to sample_to_compare.pdf to make sure the compilation was done
correctly.  If so, you can start editing your own paper.

EDITING YOUR PAPER
Now you should be able to properly compile the paper.
There are 3 files you should edit, sample.tex, samplebody.tex
and sample_bib.tex.  Feel free to replace and rename them once
you start working on your own paper.  If you would like to work 
on sections separately, you can also break out sections into 
their own intro-1.tex documents and reference them with 
\input{intro-1}.  This is the same as how samplebody is included.

Citations:
If your paper does not propoerly include citations, you need to run
bibtex <filename> to create the file for pdflatex to link to.
